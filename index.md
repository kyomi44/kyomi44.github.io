## Installing Microsoft server 2019 

Welcome to my first post!

At my current workplace there was a Dell Poweredge T610 sitting in the corner collecting dust and my gracious boss allowed me to borrow it to practice basic migrations, backups, and updates.

Hopefully by the end of this post I am able to set up the microsoft server and AD roles to mess with.

### The method

Due to being a student enrolled in University, Microsoft has a wide library of tools available (Including free $100 in azure credit!!)

I was able to get a copy of Microsoft Server 2019 as an ISO file from this resource.

A good friend and current Sys Admin (Thanks Kyle!!) told me he utilizes Rufus to install servers. Rufus according to wiki "Rufus is a free and open-source portable application for Microsoft Windows that can be used to format and create bootable USB flash drives or Live USBs"

Lets first ensure our BIOS is compatible with USB booting before creating a bootable USB!

Very simple interface and easy to use, 5 stars !!
